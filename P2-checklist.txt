_____  (5 Characters including, main player, who are incoperated into the Storyline)
	Cast: 
		- Player: Jean Micheal Basquiat (Player Icon is a low resolution Pixel representation of the book ocver of 40th anniversery of the Taschen book which has a comaplation of all his works
		- NPC 1: Dimitrios, God of Art, Craftsmanship, and Illusions
		- NPC 2: Lost Souls, in the Limbo map (Map with multiple portals)
		- NPC 3: Hermes, Messanger God 
		- NPC 4: Muse, didn't specify which of the 7


__X__  Different GAME-OVER loading screens (One for if you lose all of your lives | The other for if you complete the Game and recieve the Treasure ~ als has a 50x50 pixel Image draw onto the screen)
	~ 50x50 pixel Image of MF Doom, which is the Cover art on the album  Madvillany 
		- Image had to manually converted from uint32_t (represneted in hex) -> int (16-bit represented in hex) ~ also does not rely on using a char array, due to the number of different shades used.
		- In the future, I want to develop a python scrip that does this conversion for me, saving time.

__X__  (should have double checked to see if this may count) LOADING-SCREEN, which is queued when switching maps
	- (1) Contains an Animation with the loading ellipsis (and holds the loading screen display while (2) occurs)
	- (2) Backend of Loading Screen: Clears out all of the Map items within the previous map, then sets and Initializes the next map 
	- (3) Purpose of Development: to optomize the amount of allocated space being used within the game, 
		since previously it is not possible initialize all maps simultaniously, due to the sheer number of MapItems present within each local map.
	- () It was my simpler alternative, to manually allocate memory within the 32gb section of the mBed, which was mentioned by Daniel Cooper, in the ECE 2035 groupme,
		or having to empoly the SD Card, and then wipin the SD card after use

____  Multiple NPC's / Quests bestowed ~ (1) Dimitrios - overarching mission is to kill the muse (2) Hermes to retrieve God Butcher (a sword the Muse stole from him, however video does not show the return of the sword)

_____ There are other features that may or may not count as advanced but is what I recall getting checked off, and is alreay around the 10 mark. 
	Turing thhis game into a personal project and will have MORE FEATURE TO COME !!!!!!
